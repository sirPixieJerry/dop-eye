## The Project <a name="the-project"></a>

I became intrigued by the potential of the Document Object Model (DOM) and the utilization of div elements or SVGs for [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics). Being an artist who frequently employs vector graphics due to their scalability advantages, I had not yet experimented with SVGs within the realm of HTML. This sparked the idea of crafting a responsive rendition of [Takashi Murakmie's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Murakami) jellyfish eyes, as depicted in the provided photos.

The eye is constructed using a combination of div and SVG elements and is interactive, responding to user clicks. Upon clicking, a random RGB code is generated to color the relevant element. A mechanic is implemented to track the user's actions in the background. After five seconds of inactivity, the mechanic triggers a playback of the recorded actions, restoring the eye's colors to their original state. That's the gist of it.
